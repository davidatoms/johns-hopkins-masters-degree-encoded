# johns-hopkins-masters-degree-encoded
I am a master's degree student at Johns Hopkins University in the Applied Economics and Certificate for Financial Management program. This repository will hold the code for each class that I take. Some require coding and some don't, but I will try and create libraries for future use here, as well as showcase the work I am doing in my degree.
